                My experience recruiting and interviewing for jobs in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
            </div>
            <p>The end of recruiting season has come for me! I accepted a full time job offer yesterday and wanted to share my experience because it went very differently than I expected it to this year.</p>
            <p>Last year, I had at least 7 internship offers (can’t remember exactly and didn’t track well oops), mostly due to interviewing at GHC. This year because of less hiring and virtual GHC due to COVID, I expected it to go much worse, maybe 1 or 2 offers.</p>
            <p>I carefully tracked all of my applications on a website called <a href="https://www.huntr.co">Huntr</a>, which I highly recommend to others. It also allows me to calculate the metrics about how my applications went this year which are below.</p>
            <p>My recruiting this year started early and included utilizing the RTC Career Summit in August and the GHC database (I attended GHC but didn’t really end up doing any sessions. I did have 3 interviews during that week, which were all “GHC” interviews).</p>

            <br><h3 id="application-stats">Application stats</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>78 applications (probably 70 ish different companies)</li>
                <li>~25 coding challenges</li>

                <li>28 rejections</li>
                <li>~39 no response so far (might be lower, I stopped tracking as much once I started getting offers)</li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="application-metrics">Application metrics</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>50% response rate from applications</li>
                <li>10% interview rate from applications</li>
                <li>32% interview rate from coding challenges</li>
                <li>71% offer rate from interviews (1 offer I actually didn’t interview at all other than talk to the recruiter)</li>
                <li>8% offer rate from applications</li>
            </ul>
            <br><h3 id="strategy">Strategy</h3>
            <p>I started my applications in early August and followed this <a href="https://github.com/Pitt-CSC/NewGrad-2021">Github repo</a> and applied to many of the jobs there. I also searched on Linkedin for “software grad” about once a week to check there and kept up my own list of companies I knew I wanted to apply to and would check for their application often until it opened.</p>
            <p>I really didn’t do much Leetcode or interview prep. I followed a bit of Elements of Programming Languages in Java which is nice because I found a Github repo with method stubs and built in tests and forked that so I could also display my progress and work on <a href="https://github.com/haleykell/elements-of-programming-interviews">Github</a>. Honestly, I probably should have done more technical interview prep, but also seem to do okay with coding and I probably got lucky in my interviews.</p>
            <p>One important thing that helped me get probably at least 3 of the offers was emailing the recruiter I had last year for companies. This put my application in front of a recruiter quickly and in the case of the company I accepted a job with, led to having my resume being given straight to hiring managers. I then had one non technical interview (a couple of Java/OOP questions but no coding) with the hiring manager for the team I’m going to be joining.</p>
            <br><h3 id="results">Results</h3>
            <p>So yeah, I’m originally from Plano, TX near Dallas and actually had 3 offers in that area (all banks) but decided to accept an offer with IBM (interned in 2019) in Cambridge, MA. Other offers were in Phoenix, AZ and Los Angeles, CA. Overall, I feel like I’m pretty average at coding and especially coding interviews and have a pretty average resume overall, but I guess a couple of things (research and Minecraft mostly) are fairly unique which are good talking points in interviews. I think my strong suit is being able to interview (behavioral is better) and do fairly well under pressure. An 8% offer rate is slightly high for SWE grads, but I hear anything from 1-5%, so it’s not much higher than average. I’m not sure if my experience this year is relatable for anyone else, so I’d love to hear about other people’s COVID recruiting experiences as well.</p>
            <p>Especially since I had 3 offers in my hometown, I think it’s important to note what helped me decide. One thing I really appreciate while interviewing/recruiting is being able to know what team I would be working with and what project I’d be working on before accepting an offer. 2 out of 6 companies did this, the others had team matching after acceptance. Another thing was compensation but was a smaller part of it. Although Dallas and Boston have very different costs of living, I created an in depth budget spreadsheet to compare each offer/location with potential expenses and determine which one is best on compensation. I could probably share a template for this if people are interested. I also negotiated my offer and managed to get around 12% more for the first year and 10% more after the first year. With my spreadsheet, I was able to easily determine what I wanted to be negotiating for.</p>
            <p>I guess all this goes to say, it’s possible to get a job during the pandemic and it’s possible to get a job without doing much Leetcode! I was super surprised by how all this played out and 5 of these offers all came in the last 3 or so weeks and literally the week before that I was thinking, oh maybe I’ll just accept that first offer I got and be done with it. It’s been a crazy ride haha!</p>
            <br><h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t over work! Find a system for tracking applications and try to plan out interview prep and track that as well! I really liked being able to use a Github repo that would hold my code and help me track.</li>
                <li>Try not to stress! There’s lots of opportunities out there and opportunities for finding more opportunities as well (RTC career fairs, GHC, and a few others I’ve heard about)</li>
                <li>Find a supportive community! I have been a part of RTC since around 2017 I think and always come here first for advice. I’m also in Facebook groups Ladies Storm Hackathons and the big GHC group as well a Discord server called Intern Grind! I also tend to watch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/">r/cscareerquestions</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsgonewired/">r/girlsgonewired</a>, and some of the other CS related groups on Reddit, but r/cscareerquestions can be a bit iffy a lot of times.</li>
                <li>Always negotiate! The way my negotiation worked is I started by asking for 10% base salary and was given 5% more base + extra sign on bonus. I ended the call by saying, if there’s any more room for more on the base, I’d accept immediately. I was extremely surprised and happy to get the updated offer letter with the full 10% increase I had originally asked for, which I accepted immediately. (note: I did have a competing offer in LA which is similar cost of living that helped with this)</li>
                <li>Companies also seem to like hackathon experience, so I recommend finding some! <a href="https://devpost.com/hackathons">Devpost</a> has a lot listed right now that are virtual.</li>
